## How It Works

Your rate limit is **dynamically calculated** based on your account balance:

| Balance | RPM Limit |
|---------|-----------|
| $1 - $10 | 30 |
| $20 | 60 |
| $200 | 600 |
| $600+ | 1800 (default max) |
| Higher | Contact support |

**Formula**: `RPM = Balance × 3` (minimum 30, capped at account max)

## Rate Limit Response (429)

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "rate_limit_error",
    "code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "message": "Request rate limit exceeded. Please slow down."
  }
}
```

## Rate Limit Headers

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `x-ratelimit-limit-requests` | Your current RPM limit |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining-requests` | Remaining requests |
| `x-ratelimit-reset-requests` | Time until reset |
